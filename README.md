# Class-Activation-Maps with PyTorch and a ResNet model

This is a toy implementation of Class Activation Maps on a pre-trained
ResNet, as I did not find anything for plug- and play to generate a figure for my PhD thesis.

Feel free to use, modify, distribute.

This is the jupyter noteobok (Python3 w/ OpenCV, pyTorch, matplotlib)
[ClassActivationMaps_Demo_Resnet18.ipynb](ClassActivationMaps_Demo_Resnet18.ipynb)
